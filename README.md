Picking fonts should be illegal with how hard it is.
So I made a tool that gives you clean, cool, random font combos with one click.
No guessing. Just vibes.

â†’ Choose category
â†’ Click to shuffle
â†’ Instantly see what looks good together
â†’ Bonus: Keyboard shortcuts ðŸ‘€

Font-nerds, youâ€™re welcome
