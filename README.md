# FontPair

Picking fonts should be illegal with how hard it is.
So I made a tool that gives you clean, cool, random font combos with one click.
No guessing. Just vibes.

→ Choose category
→ Click to shuffle
→ Instantly see what looks good together
→ Bonus: Keyboard shortcuts 👀

Font-nerds, you’re welcome
